This project is part of my DIY Formula Sim Racing Wheel and focusses specifically on the HUD screen, running on a RPI Zero.

Currently, the script designer/final.py is working with the Assetto Corsa API on Playstation 5. The screen layout is modelled from
the Ferrari 488 GT3 car. 

The designer/mercProg.py is modelled from the Mercedes F1 car screen from the 2021 season. This screen is compatible with the F1 2021 game, 
using the API for playstion 5.

Both UI programs are designed in Qt5 designer, with a selectable OS (rpi/windows).
